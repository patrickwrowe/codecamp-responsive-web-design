                <p>The GAP-20 AI model was built with the aim of performing highly accurate atomistic simulations of carbon. At the time of its publication it was the first general-purpose model for performing atomistic simulations using AI. It continues to be actively used for fundamental research, and is a benchmark for accuracy against which new models are compared.</p>

                <p>GAP-20 uses the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) methodology. It describes the properties of the bulk crystalline and amorphous phases, crystal surfaces, and defect structures with an accuracy approaching that of direct quantum mechanical simulation, but at a significantly reduced computational cost.</p>

                <div class="section-div"></div>

                <p>The GAP-20 model was rigorously validated by assessing its ability to reproduce the physical properties of carbon. In addition to idealised crystalline structures, the characteristics of an extensive set of defect structures, surfaces and surface reconstructions were checked against quantum mechanical benchmark calculations.</p>

                <p>Phonon dispersion relations are particularly important for carbon-based materials (such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, and diamond) because they influence several key physical properties, accurately reproducing the phonon dispersions demonstrates that the model can accurately reproduce:</p>

                <ul id="phonons-list">
                    <li>Thermal Conductivity: Carbon-based materials often exhibit exceptionally high thermal conductivity, especially graphene and diamond.</li>
                    <li>Mechanical Properties: The stiffness and strength of materials depend on how atoms vibrate within the lattice. For example, graphene's high Young's modulus (stiffness) is linked to its unique phonon dispersion, where the in-plane optical and acoustic phonon branches contribute to its rigidity.</li>
                    <li>Electronic-Phonon Interactions: In semiconducting carbon materials (like carbon nanotubes), phonons can scatter electrons, impacting electrical conductivity and charge carrier mobility. This is crucial for designing high-performance nanoelectronic devices.</li>
                    <li>Anharmonic Effects and Superconductivity: In some carbon-based materials, interactions between phonons can lead to unusual quantum effects, such as high-temperature superconductivity (as seen in doped diamond or fullerenes).</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The GAP-20 model has been shown independently to reproduce the <a href="#cit-structure-modelling">temperature-pressure phase diagram of carbon.</a> This demonstrates that the model not only accurately models the individual crystalline phases of the material, but also its transitions from one phase to another as changes in temperature and pressure are undergone.</p>

                    <div class="fig-div"></div>
                </figure>

                <p>The model also accurately reproduces the structures and energies of defects in carbon structures. Point defects—such as vacancies, interstitials, and substitutional atoms—play a crucial role in determining the physical properties of carbon-based materials. Understanding them is essential for applications in electronics, mechanics, and energy storage.</p>

                <ul id="defects-list">
                    <li>Electronic Properties: In semiconducting carbon materials (like graphene nanoribbons or carbon nanotubes), point defects can introduce localized electronic states, modify band gaps, and act as charge traps. This is useful for tailoring electronic transport in nanoelectronic devices.</li>
                    <li>Thermal Conductivity: Carbon-based materials, especially graphene and diamond, rely on phonon transport for heat conduction. Point defects scatter phonons, reducing thermal conductivity. This can be beneficial for thermoelectrics, where lower thermal conductivity improves efficiency.</li>
                    <li>Chemical Reactivity and Functionalization: Defects often serve as active sites for chemical reactions. In graphene, for example, vacancies or substitutional atoms can enhance adsorption properties, making defective graphene useful for sensors, catalysis, and energy storage applications (e.g., Li-ion batteries).</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Since its publication, the GAP-20 potential has been used a wide range of applications.</p>
                <p>In the realm of random structure searches, GAP-20 has been instrumental in exploring the potential energy landscapes of carbon. By efficiently sampling these landscapes, researchers have identified novel carbon allotropes with unique properties. For instance, a study demonstrated the use of GAP-20 in conjunction with the nested sampling algorithm to uncover new carbon structures, highlighting its capability in <a class="link-citation" href="cit-structure-modelling">predicting stable configurations</a> that were previously unknown.</p>
